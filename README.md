# Chris' Magic: the Gathering Deck Builder

This is a simple and clean tool for building M:tG decks, getting all card information from the [https://magicthegathering.io/] API.

Users will be able to search for cards by their name or rules text of course, but will also be able to apply various filters to narrow down their search as well.
